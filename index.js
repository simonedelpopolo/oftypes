/**
 * Configurable typeof responses.
 *
 * **all the primitives are covered:**
 *   - BigInt
 *   - Boolean
 *   - Buffer(Node.js)
 *   - String
 *   - Number
 *   - Promise
 *   - undefined
 *   - Symbol
 *   - null
 *
 * **these are also checked as types:**
 *   - NaN
 *   - AsyncFunction
 *
 * **to differentiate all the ObjectsTypes is used 'constructor.name' property**
 *   - "null" and "undefined" are taken off from this condition and threaded as separate types.
 *   - Javascript ESModule.

 * **examples â‡©**.
